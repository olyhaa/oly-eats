  "ingredientTitle1": "Crust",
  "ingredients1": "8 ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\n1/2 ounce sugar\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n8 ounces unsalted butter, cold\n4 ounces cold tap water",
  "ingredientTitle2": "Filling",
  "ingredients2": "3 eggs\n¾ cup sugar\n½ t salt\n¾ t ginger\n1 ¼ t cinnamon\n⅜ t nutmeg\n⅜ t clove\n1 ½ cups pumpkin\n¾ cup evaporated milk (or 1 ¼ cups milk)",
  "directionsTitle1": "Make the Crust",
  "directions1": "Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Cut butter into cubes no smaller than 1/2-inch, and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces. With your fingertips, smash each cube flat—that's it! No rubbing or cutting. Stir in water, then knead dough against the sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball. Dough temperature should register between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before rolling and folding.\nMake the Layers: On a generously floured work surface, roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch rectangle. Fold the 10-inch sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book. Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block. Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper. Dough temperature should still be somewhere between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C); if not, refrigerate briefly before proceeding (see note).\nUsing as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch circle; this size allows ample room to line the pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border. At smaller sizes, the dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape the edges, and the thicker dough will not crisp as intended. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate; the dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into the very corners of the pan. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim the edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches all around. Fold overhang over itself to create a thick border that sits on the top edge of the pie plate, not below. Crimp or shape crust as desired. Repeat with remaining dough. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. ",
